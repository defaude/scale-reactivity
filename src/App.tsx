        <p>And this is a Scale TextField with custom event binding (but "a" characters are behaving REALLY weird):</p>

        <p>This is a regular input field where just the value is bound (making it a read-only field effectively):</p>

      <section>
        <p>... and the Scale TextField only has the value bound, too (but you still can type in it and update its internal state):</p>

        <p>These are three separate checkboxes each with their on value and change handler. Their "disabled" attribute is set to "undefined" (as is "allowed" when I'm looking at the typing. My expectation is that they are not disabled and work normally. However, take a look what happens when any of them is clicked for the first time:</p>
